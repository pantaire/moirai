# concept/prompt
a death god that is actually surprisingly supportive and on the side of the good guys, supporting actions and promoting policies that will lead to the kingdom  
growing and thriving instead of being destroyed, because the more the kingdom grows, the more people there are, and the more people there are that will eventually die, and when
you're an immortal god of death, you know there's no need to rush. you'll get them all in the end.  

# story
There was this legend in our town. It was said, a strange woman came to help those who desperately needed something. Some claimed to have seen her, wandering the 
streets alone, dressed in all business clothes, heels clicking on the streets. Most were afraid of her, as it was also said that she brought death. Her heels were 
said to sound like a ticking clock, counting down somebodys last seconds. Her attire as serious as death itself. 
A few tried to find her, put themselves in danger, even injured themselves, to make her visit and save them. They had no success this far. Most of them went to far and died
in the process. 
Unlike them, I know her very well. She gets up early in the morning, goes for a run before breakfast, then leaves the house again. Most days, she returns late, her steps heavier
than in the morning. I don't know where she goes. I even might be a little afraid to know. The walls between our apartments are thin enough to hear her sing in the shower.
