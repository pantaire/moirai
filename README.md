# FATES 
telling a story about an ancient story teller and her sisters, who might have been even greater than the gods themselves.  
A Homage to the three Moirai, or Fates:  
Clotho, presence, the weaver  
Lachesis, future, the measurer  
Atropos, past, the cutter  
who work together spinning and shaping our world. May they be honored.
