Plot: the 3 moirai decided fates for a long time. They held enormous power to which even the mightiest of gods bowed. 
For a long time, things went great and as planned. Sure, bad things happened - but this was part of a greater plan. 
Over time, more and more people decided to take their fate into their own hands. 

But with the changing times, Clotho and Lachesis decided to build their own fate and pursue different careers: Clotho left first and became a famous seamstress. 
Soon after, Lachesis abandons Atropos to become an architect. Lachesis takes her own thread of fate with her and is never seen again. 

(change in Background: Between the books of written down fates, there appear more "live your life to the fullest", "follow your dreams" and "fate is not real")

Atropos, devoid of her vision of present and future, decides to carry on spinning the threads of fate and takes on the additional jobs of measuring and cutting the fates.
Things go wrong: At first, the threads spun by her twist and fray, resulting in twists of fate and strange turns in peoples lifes. 
For she can only see the past, she has to guess how long to cut the threads. 
Sometimes, this goes completely wrong: Children die too young, dictators live too long and cause unnecessary harm to their citizens, people are ripped from their loved ones way too soon. 

Eventually, Atropos almost cuts Clothos thread - in the last second, she realizes her mistake. 
This leads to Clotho being severely injured due to an accident at her work. After her recovery (as Atropos mends her thread), she returns to Atropos, assuming that she hurt her intentionally to bring her back home.
Clotho brings home news of Lachesis committing suicide by jumping off her highest building and ripping her thread on the way down. 
They both exchange stories and decide to live on together, spinning and cutting off the threads of fate. 
Though nothing can replace lachesis, they try their best in guessing the right measurements.
