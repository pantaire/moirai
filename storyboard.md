## Atropos, off camera: 
A long time ago, we three sisters held the fate of the world in our hands. Figuratively speaking.   
We answered to no one, as we were responsible for, well, everybody. Sure, we also were to blame for everything, even the bad things.  
But even the gods who created us, bowed down before our work, knowing that respecting us was for their own best.  
For we spun the fates. For each destiny, we wove a thread. We  carefully cradled it, twisting it, intertwining them with each other where we saw fit. 
But every thread had to be cut, according to its destiny. We measured each one rigorously. 
Sometimes we thinned their ends, weakened the fiber, preparing them for their ends. Other times, the cut was sharp and unexpected. 
Each destiny was written down, preserving their story. If this consoles you: You won't be forgotten. I, personally, will carry on your legacy. 
## Atropos, mouth in camera, camera zooming out, sitting at her desk in the library, muttering to herself. Camera behind her, arm is moving  
I am Atropos, the oldest of the Moirai. Although you might know us better by our other name, "the Fates". And this is our story. 
For aeons, things went great. We three sisters, Clotho, Lachesis and me, Atropos, worked together in peace, fulfilling our duty. 
We dwelled, because people believed in us. But then, doubt began to grow inside Clotho. 
## Clotho, slamming door, screaming: 
What is wrong with you? You guys are really settling for an eternity of THIS? We are withering, nobody knows us anymore. 
## Lachesis, from behind the door, filmed from above: 
Clotho, open up! Think about the future! Who will do this, if not us?
## Atropos, besides Lachesis, filmed from behind their heads: 
We were destined to spin the threads. You can't just leave. 
## Clotho, throwing things around: 
Guys, you. don't. understand. We're responsible for so many bad things. People are torn from their loved ones, some don't even HAVE someone to love when we cut them! Why can't we let them live? 
## Lachesis and Atropos exchanging a look, Lachesis looking down, Atropos furrowing her brows
## Nighttime, Lachesis and Atropos sleeping, Clotho laying with open eyes. 
## Cut to the tower outside, something hitting the floor, a silhouette jumping afterwards, Clotho taking a deep breath, fading to the moon, 
## Cut to Lachesis holding a newspaper with Clotho on front page, Lachesis saying:
You know, sometimes i envy her. Just... leaving everything behind. Living in the moment, not caring about the past or the future...like us. 
## Atropos, frantically trying to produce a new thread, twisting it in the process:
I still can't believe she left us. Without even showing us how to weave. 
## Atropos fails, the thread splinters like glass, Lachesis flinches and turn
Oh no, another one. Twisted and way too young. 
## Lachesis, walking towards her: 
Atropos, stop. You are ripping them of their futures. Try harder or let me try. Every one of your fails hurts me. Don't mess with the future. 
## Atropos, hiding the threads behind her body:
No. 
## Atropos, narrating the next 4 lines: 
Lachesis could not bear to see the future in shambles. She left to find Clotho, to restore order. 
## Cut to Lachesis entering the library alone (focusing on her shoes stepping in, filmed from below), extracting a clump of yarn and taking it with her
## Cut to Lachesis walking around, flinching from pain every now and then. 
## She walks on, flinching, being thrown down to earth, her shadow growing longer.
## As the sun sets behind her, she pulls out her ball of yarn, flinching again, the ball crumbles to dust.
## The world turns as she falls to earth a last time.
## Atropos from off camera, as the view turns to black: 
There is no more future. 
## Atropos, writing in the book from the beginning, but now with a much older hand, and an older voice: 
I have never heard from Clotho again. 
## Camera changing to a view of her back, now hunched over, light is darker, but a warmer tone
This is our story. A story of aeons, supposed to go on for all eternity. I carried on as long as possible. I documented everything. But without my sisters, the presence and future, my story will soon reach its end. My old hands can no longer spin the yarn. 
## Camera shows her walking along a path of books to reach the middle of another room, her voice carries on from off camera
May a kind soul find this. And maybe continue our work. Let me rest now. The past is over.
